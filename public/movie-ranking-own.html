<h3>Avengers : Endgame</h3>
<p>
    This movie is one of the greatest superheroes movie of all time. 
    The VFX was 10/10.
</p>

<h3>Avengers : Infinity-War</h3>
<p>
    Another movie from the MCU that was a blockbuster. 
    Watching it in 4K quality felt like I saw a different world.

<h3>Raatsasan</h3>
<p>
    A Tamil psycho-thriller movie which is my favourite thriller movie. 
    Eventhough it's not a horror movie, it still scares me.
